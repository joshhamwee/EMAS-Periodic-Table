# Software Project Engineering

## Executive Summary

The following is a proposal for our Software Product Engineering project, undergone by Josh Hamwee, Andrei Bogdan, Finn Wilkinson, Sharlene D'Silva and Kshitij Upmanyu.

### Client

The client we are working with is the European Microbeam Analysis Society, _EMAS_. Our primary source of contact is with Mike Matthews, the chairman and creator of the EMAS Periodic Table. EMAS is a non-profit organisation run for and by scientists working in the related field. The Society is independent, but co-operates closely with national and international microbeam analysis groups, and other European societies with related interests. Founded in 1989 with its primary purposes being **Education, Communication** and **Innovation**. The activities of the Society promote this branch of science and stimulate technical and scientific developments on a European scale.

### Application Domain

The application domain of the product in which we are going to develop is that of the EMAS group. This comes under that of Earth Sciences and Chemistry.

### The Problem

Currently the EMAS group is using A3 sized periodic tables, and large data books to look up the necessary data. This is a laborious task especially when each individual element can have different X-ray position units dependant on the machine that is being used, and which crystals are used within this machine.

The second problem is that of converting units between different machines. There are two large manufacturers of Electron Microscopes, _JEOL_ and _CAMECA_. Both companies use different frames of reference for X-ray positions across a spectrometer. This can make it confusing to analyse data, and brings added difficultly when having to compare data between the machines.

### Our Vision / Solution

What we have envisioned for this product is an Android App which would solve majority of the current issues that the EMAS group is facing. The main focus of the application would be to make data more accessible to the user. So how would this application work?

Our current idea is to transfer the periodic table that EMAS is currently using onto your phone/tablet. This periodic table would be interactive, so if an element was clicked on, further information would be delivered to the user. The information provided would be more detailed than that of the original periodic table as the screen would provide much more space, including a scrolling aspect to accommodate more data.

One of the problems that we believe is necessary to solve is the issue with units. We are going to try to eliminate this problem by creating a toggle on the detailed information page for the element, which will allow the user to easily switch between the two necessary units.

We believe that accessing data quickly is a very important feature for any application, so to implement this into our solution we will create a search bar that will be able to look up elements by both their name and symbol.
